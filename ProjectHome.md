## Javascript OpenID Selector ##

This is a simple Javascript OpenID selector. It has been designed so that users do not even need to know what OpenID is to use it, they simply select their account by a recognisable logo.

Take a look at the [FAQ](FAQ.md) if you'd like to integrate OpenID Selector w/ Facebook or Twitter or [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/).

**A [demo based on JQuery is available here](http://openid-selector.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo.html).**
A [demo based on MooTools](http://openid-selector.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo-mootools.html) rather than JQuery is available here. A [demo based on Prototype](http://openid-selector.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo-prototype.html) is also available. A Google Closure version is available in SVN trunk.

Features include:
  * Can easily add and remove provider buttons.
  * Unobtrusive Javascript - Still works with Javascript turned off.
  * Remembers OpenID provider choice by using a cookie.
  * Works with any OpenID libraries since it is just HTML and Javascript.
  * Minimal CSS styling so you can easily customise the login box.
  * CSS sprites
  * Internationalization support; [Russian](http://openid-selector.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo-ru.html), [Ukrainian](http://openid-selector.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/demo-uk.html), German, Japanese translations.
